                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    From the depths of Barcelona comes Flames of Foe! This fascinating experimental rock band has been creating its own path with a proposal that mixes demolishing riffs and melodies that stay with you long after the music stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The band burst onto the scene with two powerful singles released in 2017 and 2018, making it clear that they were not coming to follow established formulas. Their rhythms are so complex that even metronomes ask for time off after trying to follow themâ€”some say their time signature changes have caused existential crises in renowned mathematicians!
                </p>
                <p>
                    During 2019, far from slowing down their momentum, they released an interesting EP of remixes that demonstrated their willingness to explore new sonic territories and reinterpret their own creations. A collection that turned their already twisted structures into authentic sonic labyrinths where getting lost is surprisingly pleasurable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2022 was the year of the big leap! Their debut album dropped like a bombshell on the local scene, capturing the essence of what makes Flames of Foe special: that magical combination of instrumental strength with irresistible melodic hooks that conquers purists and newcomers alike. Songs that make you wonder how it's possible to move your head to the beat when even the band members aren't sure what time they're playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stages of Barcelona have vibrated with their presence, Madrid has been witness to their live power, and numerous other cities in the world have been treated to their electrifying performances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flames of Foe is about to give a new blow on the table with the release of their long-awaited second album. This new release has been recorded at the legendary Siete Barbas Estudio under the hand of Daniel Gil, a true sound genius and an undisputed name in Barcelona's circuit of independent bands. With such a combination, this album promises to raise the bar of experimentation and riffage even higher.
                </p>
                <p>
