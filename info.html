                    Emerging from the depths of the Barcelona underground, Flames of Foe is a fascinating experimental rock power trio that has been creating its own path with a recipe that mixes crushing riffs with melodies that seem to linger in your psyche like a slow burning furnace.

                    The band appeared in the scene with two powerful singles released in 2017 and 2018, making it clear that they were not here to follow the norm.

                    During 2019, far from slowing down their momentum, they released an interesting EP of remixes that demonstrated their willingness to explore new sonic territories and reinterpret their own creations. A collection of international collaborations that turned their twisted sounds into authentic sonic labyrinths where getting lost is a rhythmic exploration.

                    In 2022 their debut album and music video made some noise in the scene, capturing the essence of what makes Flames of Foe special: that magical combination of instrumental surprise and melodic sensibility that conquers long time fans and newcomers alike. Songs that make you wonder how it's possible to move your head in 9/8.

                    The stages of Barcelona have vibrated with their presence, Madrid has been witness to their live shows, and other cities in Spain have been treated to their energetic performances.

                    Flames of Foe is about to give a new blow on the table with the release of their long-awaited second album. This new release has been recorded at the legendary Siete Barbas Estudio under the hand of distortion guru Daniel Gil, an undisputed name in Barcelona's circuit of independent bands. With such a combination, this album promises to raise their bar of experimentation and riffage even higher.
